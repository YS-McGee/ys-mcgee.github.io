## Ubuntu (24) is stuck on [ OK ] Started gdm.service

### Problem
Yesterday I was messing around with Arduino IDE on my Ubuntu 24, because I want to add it to my application entry. But after some point, my machine first stuck at login page. Later, when I tried to reboot, it then stuck at a booting page like this [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/17e158d/ubuntu_2310_is_stuck_on_ok_started_gdmservice/). 

```
[OK] Started gdm.service - GNOME Display Manager.ntil boot process finishes up...porting is enabled..r based).
```

Turns out to be the FUSE package I installed previously [Arduino_Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/arduino-appimage-from-application-on-ubuntu-linux-and-add-to-favorite-menu/1146433/1).

### Solution

The solution should be really straight forward. BUT, I tried so many times finding the root shell prompt. I kind of forget how I got there finally, but here are the steps roughly:

1. boot into GRUB page by entering BIOS (F11 / F12 / ESC / Enter, depending on the machine).
2. after getting the shell, you should see your username and install the desktop package.

```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
reboot
```

3. After rebooting everything will be the alright.

### Appendix

I also tried the below tutorial to get to GRUB shell, but I'm not sure if it is helpful as the GRUB shell does not have `apt` command, this is just to help booting the ubuntu.
